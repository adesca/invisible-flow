# Use create-react-app

## Status

accepted

## Context

Needed a React front end with testing all built in.

## Decision

Use create-react-app to set up frontend application and testing infrastructure

## Consequences

Getting started with TDD since testing is all built in we can start coding out of the box
without creating and maintaining all the needed infrastrcture to support the application and 
testing

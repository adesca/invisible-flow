# Use create-react-app

## Status

accepted

## Context

- Needed a front end with testing capabilities built in so that we can more easily test our code.
- React is preferred because people at Thoughtworks tend to have more experience with it, so
it allows us to attract devs interested in learning react.


## Decision

Use create-react-app to set up frontend application and testing infrastructure

## Consequences

- TDD is easier because testing works without forcing us to maintain custom testing tools

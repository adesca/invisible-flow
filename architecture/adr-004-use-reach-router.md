# Use Reach Router

## Status

proposed

## Context

The need here is to be able to change to a different view based on user interaction in app.
Example: User clicks Scrape COPA Data button, app page should change and display information 
about the scrape operation.

## Decision

Adding a router so that we can display multiple pages/paths to the user as needed.

## Consequences

Having multiple pages with differing needs, for example, inputting foia request data, 
or showing status of COPA scraping job
